# Motion Retargeting to Pepper using BlazePose
This framework is designed to achieve motion retargeting to Pepper robot based on the human pose estimation library of Google MediaPipe Pose (BlazePose).

The file "3DMotion.py" is written in Python 3 and is an integration of BlazePose and several algorithms. The files "Input.py" and "Output.py" run using Python 2 on Naoqi SDK of Pepper from Softbank Robotics.
